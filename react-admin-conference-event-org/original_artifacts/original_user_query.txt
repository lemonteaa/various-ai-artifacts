Using `react-admin` (a famous low-code rapid prototyping app library), create a purpose made app to help an event organizer that's planning a small conference. (It's still in the ideation phase so we don't have specifics in mind, it's more like a tech demo to validate the concept of using B2B/ERP/CRM style app for this new class of problems) The conference will invites speakers (so talk proposal submission + selection process), and will have overseas attendees (so need to arrange airplane ticket + accommodation/hotel). Also need some sort of overall project management feature (eg task dependency, notice on task deadlines...). The emerging generalizable theme seems to be collective decision making + specific decision flow + information distribution. As such multi-user with different roles (and access to/logic of features changing depending on the role) is necessary. Tech note: - MVP only, no significant tech component allowed beyond `react-admin` - please use `ra-data-local-forage` as the data provider which will allow testing the app without having a backend (it will use browser's IndexedDB) - In the same browser-local DB (IndexedDB), please have some place to store user/role/authen info => password based login, custom react-admin authen provider? - Scaffold with a few pre-existing user, one to three for each role. (Citing the doc: "By default, the data provider starts with no resource. To set default data if the IndexedDB is empty, pass a JSON object as the defaultData argument. The defaultData parameter must be an object literal with one key for each resource type. Values are arrays of resources. Resources must be object literals with at least an id key. Foreign keys are also supported: just name the field {related_resource_name}_id and give an existing value.")
