prompt = f"<document_list> <document id=\"conservative_refactor\">{old_src}</document> <document id=\"aggressive_refactor\">{new_src}</document> </document_list> Attached above are the complete source code of two different branches of a codebase where we want to do a major refactor to repay the technical debt. (The original pre-refactor source code is not shown) It is a html5 game that is completely self-contained (single html page, no further dependencies except for JS library loaded using CDN method). I like the aggressive branch better, but worry that in the process some feature/functionalities are accidentally lost as the aggressive branch seems to have shorter line of code overall. Can you help me do a code review and check if there is any cause for concern? Thanks."
