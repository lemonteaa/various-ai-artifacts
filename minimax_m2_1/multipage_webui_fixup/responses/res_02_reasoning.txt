The user wants me to continue developing the UI for this Age of Empires-style RTS game prototype. Specifically, they want:

1. A diplomacy screen with:
   - A button next to the menu button in the top right corner
   - A table with rows for each player
   - Columns: Name, Relation, Tribute (with 3 buttons: food, wood, gold)
   - Clicking tribute buttons shows a number on top (+100 each time)
   - Column names at the top

2. Enhanced "Prepare Game" screen:
   - Two column layout
   - Left column: table list of players with per-player settings (civilization, color, AI/Human)
   - Right column: global settings (map size, resources, etc.)
   - Based on the original uploaded doc description

I need to:
1. Preserve the existing visual design (low poly aesthetic, consistent colors)
2. Add the new diplomacy button to the top menu
3. Create a new diplomacy modal with a table layout
4. Redesign the prepare screen with a two-column layout
5. Add player slot management (add/remove players)
6. Style everything consistently with the existing code

Let me create a comprehensive update that includes all these features while maintaining the existing UI's look and feel.
